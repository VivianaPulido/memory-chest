# Memory Chest
This is my second module project for Ironhack bootcamp.<br/>
It is a website with the purpose of registering memories. The user can create an account, create a memory with an image, visualize all his/her memories in a dashboard, edit them and delete them.

Deploy: http://memorychest.herokuapp.com/
